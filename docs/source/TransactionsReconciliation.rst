Transactions reconciliation
---------------------------

Except the before mentioned methods for obtaining the transaction
outcome statuses (callbacks with retry mechanisms and check status API)
there is a possibility of configuring partnerâ€™s FTP server access. This
server would be used for daily push of all of the transactions
registered the previous day in CSV file format.
